\arguments{
\item{input.dir}{character; path to directory containing input files. Default is NULL.}

\item{paired}{logical; are their paired R1 and R2 files that should be analyzed concurrently? Default is TRUE.}

\item{tmp.dir}{character; path to temporary directory for direct output. After files are written here, they will be moved to \code{output.dir}. Default is NULL.}

\item{output.dir}{character; path to storage directory for output. If no \code{tmp.dir} output will be written here, otherwise it will be written to \code{tmp.dir} first and then moved here. Default is '.'.}

\item{src.tool.path}{character; path to script for sourcing tool, if required by system, this will also append the command \verb{source <PATH> ; } to the full commands. NULL means this is not prepended. Default is NULL.}

\item{zip.output}{logical; whether to gzip final output (occurs before moving files if \code{tmp.dir} is set). Default is TRUE.}

\item{write.to}{character; file name to write commands to, if NULL, only returns commands as character vector. Default is NULL}

\item{...}{other commands to pass to appropriate tool. Names must match short or long version found in that tool's help page.}
